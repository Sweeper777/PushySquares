        <ul>
            
            <li><i>The goal is to push opponents’ squares off the board.</i></li>
            <li>Each player decides their color.</li>
            <li>In the beginning, each player has one square.</li>
            <li>In each turn, the player can move their squares by swiping upwards, downwards, to the left or to the right.</li>
            <li>New squares will be given to each player at the starting point as the game goes on.</li>
            <li>This shows the number of moves after which a new square will appear.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="new square in.png"/>
        <ul>
            <li>But if the starting point is occupied when a new square is due, that new square will not appear.</li>
            <li>All squares of each player move simultaneously by each swipe.</li>
            <li>White squares are “walls”, which block the movement of the square(s) that move(s) against them.</li>
            <li>In some maps, there are slippery tiles. If a square moves onto a slippery tile and there is nothing blocking it, it will slip forward one more square.</li>
            <li>For every square pushed off the board, the player loses one life.</li>
            <li>This shows the number of remaining lives of each player.</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="lives.png"/>
        <ul>
            <li>When all lives are lost, the player is out of the game but all their remaining squares will stay and become gray, and remain moveable.</li>
            <li>The last man standing wins.</li>
        </ul>
        <center><h1>How to Have a Multi-device Game</h1></center>
        <ul>
            <li>One of the players taps on "HOST" on their own device.</li>
            <li>All the detected devices around will be shown.</li>
            <li>All other players tap on "JOIN" so they can be detected.</li>
            <li>Players can be detected if they are connected to the same WiFi network or their Bluetooth is turned on.</li>
            <li>The player who tapped on "HOST" can then tap on the devices that they want to connect to the game.</li>
            <li>After all the devices have been connected, the player who tapped on "HOST" taps on the start button to start the game.</li>
            <li>The color of each player is decided automatically.</li>
        </ul>
